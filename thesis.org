#+TITLE: AI for personalization: from predictive to generative modeling.

\abstract{Personalization on streaming platforms is oftentimes perceived as a purely predictive phenomenon: we propose to view it as a comprehensive and responsible generative approach, throughout a pipeline. We introduce RecFusion to issue recommendations in a generative way with diffusion models, as part of the nascent Generative Information Retrieval field. For these recommendations, we propose a method to generate personalized stills from movies, with sigmoidF1. We show that the resulting interactions on platforms are also dependent on implicit data hidden from a web analytics platform, with our intent-satisfaction analysis. At the end of the pipeline, we propose to ensure normative diversity in the issued recommendations with our RADio metrics framework.}
