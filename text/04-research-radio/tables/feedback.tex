\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item ``Reproducing an article was hard and intensive but a really good experience.''
     \item ``Replicating another study, seeing how (poorly) other research is performed was really eye-opening.''
    \item ``Reproducing a paper: I believe this is a good thing to do and is an important part of academia.''
    \item  ``Gave good insights into the trustworthiness of research papers, which is apparently not great.''
    \item ``I appreciate the critical view I have developed on papers as a result of this course. Normally I would easily accept the content of a paper, but I will be more critical from now on, as many papers are not reproducible.''
    \item ``I think it's really good that we get some practical insights into reproducing results from other papers, not all papers are as good as they seem to be.''
    \item ``I really appreciated that this was the first course where students are judging state-of-the-art AI-models. In other words, students were able to experience the scientific workfield of AI.''

(b) Feedback from the ML Reproducibility Challenge \\
\midrule
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item ``The report reveals a lot of dark spots of the original paper.''
\item ``Good reviews, strong reproducibility report, provides code reimplementation from scratch which is a strong contribution.''
\item ``The discussion section is a great reference point for future work.''
\item ``The additional experimentation is rather impressive and the report reflects  an intuitive understanding of concepts such as  coverage, correctness, and counterfactual explanations.''
\item ``The report provides good insights on how the experiments in the original paper actually work, while also generating new hypothesis to be tested for future research, which is a positive outcome.''
\item ``My main concern is that it remains unclear why some of the results are so far off from the original paper? I would have expected the authors to dig deeper on that.''
%\item ``The paper is generally difficult to follow. The paper reads closer to an outline than a finished report.''
\item ``It doesn't go above and beyond the reproduction and does not offer novel insights into the workings of the original paper.''
\item ``The submission failed at reproducing the original results. It is unclear whether this is due to a difference in the experimental setup or due to implementation errors. ''
%\item ``The paper reads closer to an outline than a finished report. I would encourage the authors to spend some additional time on organization, making sure that the key takeaways are made plain and that the report reads fluidly throughout.''
