Video streaming platforms have changed the way people consume and interact with digital media. They use machine learning to deliver personalized and recommended content to users based on their behavior and preferences. This thesis investigates how these platforms work, focusing on the different aspects of the user journey on a video streaming platform. The main goal is to understand and improve the personalization and recommendation systems that enhance the user experience. Platforms have to balance user satisfaction, content diversity, and ethical responsibility.

The \emph{user journey} consists of several steps. First, users come to the platform with some \emph{intents} (e.g., binge-watching a series, finding a family-friendly movie, discovering new genres, etc.). Then, they see a customized home page with various horizontal \emph{recommendation} strips. Each strip contains videos with (sometimes personalized) \emph{thumbnails}. Next, users interact with the platform by leaving \emph{behavioral} signals (e.g., clicks, watch time, bookmarks, ratings, etc.). Finally, the platform tries to measure the usersâ€™ \emph{satisfaction} by analyzing their behavior and feedback. Besides satisfying the users, the platform also has to ensure that the content it offers is \emph{diverse} and does not promote any biased or harmful views.

This thesis presents some novel methods and tools for improving the pipeline along this user journey. The pipeline includes collecting user data, analyzing user behavior, building predictive models, testing different strategies, and evaluating the outcomes. These steps help to capture user intent, preferences, and interaction patterns; the input for personalization tools. The tools we propose here are: a generative model for creating diverse and relevant recommendation strips for the home page; a multilabel classifier for selecting optimal thumbnails for each video; a survey-based method for predicting user satisfaction from intent and behavior; and a set of metrics for measuring content diversity and avoiding unwanted biases.

In short, we offer a comprehensive overview of the video streaming platform ecosystem, exploring the challenges and opportunities of personalization, recommendation, and user behavior analysis. By combining survey methods, content modeling, adaptive testing, and behavioral analysis, this study aims to contribute to the development of video streaming platforms that can provide better user satisfaction and engagement in a responsible way.
