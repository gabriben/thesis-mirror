Video streaming platforms have changed the way people consume and interact with digital media \tocite{}. Using machine learning to deliver personalized and recommended content to users based on their behavior and preferences is not something new~\cite{oldPersonalizationBehavior, oldPersonalizationSearch}. At first, personalization was restricted to email newsletters, then appeared on the platform in a form of 1 dimensional lists \tocite{}. Now personalization is in the ordering of the strip, the thumbnail, in the font title of the thumbnail, in search \tocite{}. The outcome is an entire \emph{user journey} steered by the platforms algorithms. For the purpose of this thesis, we will call this combination of algorithms, the \emph{personalization pipeline}. This pipeline is geared towards simple KPIs like number of minutes seen \tocite{} and churn rate \tocite{}, but is linked with a responsibility to balance longer term user satisfaction, content diversity, and ethical considerations \tocite{}.

\paragraph{The user journey} consists of several steps. First, users come to the platform with some \emph{intents} (e.g., binge-watching a series, finding a family-friendly movie, discovering new genres, etc.)~\cite{intent}. Then, they see a customized home page with various horizontal \emph{recommendation} strips (see Figure~\ref{fig:VLStrip}). Each strip contains videos with (sometimes personalized) \emph{thumbnails}. Over time, users interact with the platform and leave \emph{behavioral} signals (e.g., clicks, watch time, bookmarks, ratings, etc.). From the platform's perspective, deciphering how these behaviors, prompted by user intents, translate into overall \emph{satisfaction} remains a complex challenge. Besides satisfying the users, the platform also has to ensure that the content it offers is \emph{diverse} and does not promote any biased or harmful views.

\paragraph{The personalization pipeline...}
This thesis presents some novel methods and tools for improving the pipeline along this user journey. The pipeline includes collecting user data, analyzing user behavior, building predictive models, testing different strategies, and evaluating the outcomes. These steps help to capture user intent, preferences, and interaction patterns; the input for personalization tools.

\paragraph{knowledge gap...} dssdsd

The tools we propose here are: a generative model for creating diverse and relevant recommendation strips for the home page; a multilabel classifier for selecting optimal thumbnails for each video; a survey-based method for predicting user satisfaction from intent and behavior; and a set of metrics for measuring content diversity and avoiding unwanted biases.

In short, we offer a comprehensive overview of the video streaming platform ecosystem, exploring the challenges and opportunities of personalization, recommendation, and user behavior analysis. By combining survey methods, content modeling, adaptive testing, and behavioral analysis, this study aims to contribute to the development of video streaming platforms that can provide better user satisfaction and engagement in a responsible way.
