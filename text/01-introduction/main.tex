Video streaming platforms have changed the way people consume and interact with digital media \tocite{}. Using machine learning to deliver personalized and recommended content to users based on their behavior and preferences is not something new~\cite{oldPersonalizationBehavior, oldPersonalizationSearch}. At first, personalization was restricted to email newsletters, then appeared on the platform in a form of 1 dimensional lists \tocite{}. Now personalization is in the ordering of the strip, the thumbnail, in the font title of the thumbnail, in search \tocite{}. The outcome is an entire \emph{user journey} (the user's perspective) steered by the platforms algorithms. For the purpose of this thesis, we will call this combination of algorithms, the \emph{personalization pipeline} (the platform's perspective). This pipeline is geared towards simple KPIs like number of minutes seen \tocite{} and churn rate \tocite{}, but is linked with a responsibility to balance longer term user satisfaction, content diversity, and ethical considerations \tocite{}.

\paragraph{The user journey} consists of several steps. First, users come to the platform with some \emph{intents} (e.g., binge-watching a series, finding a family-friendly movie, discovering new genres, etc.)~\cite{intent}. Then, they see a customized home page with various horizontal \emph{recommendation} strips (see Figure~\ref{fig:VLStrip}). Each strip contains videos with (sometimes personalized) \emph{thumbnails}. Over time, users interact with the platform and leave \emph{behavioral} signals (e.g., clicks, watch time, bookmarks, ratings, etc.). From the platform's perspective, deciphering how these behaviors, prompted by user intents, translate into overall \emph{satisfaction} remains a complex challenge.

\paragraph{The personalization pipeline} is our description of the accumulation of a platform's algorithms that cater for a better user journey. The pipeline includes collecting user data, analyzing user behavior. These signals, also called user feedback are often provided by an external analytics business and the signal granularity is limited by the amount of data and how much a streaming platform is willing to pay \tocite{}. It can range from number of item watched (just one data point per user session) all the way to recordings of all mouse movements (thousands of data points per session). With that session-level data, streaming platforms attempt to predict what the user will do, to adapt the user journey to the user: the next movie to watch, the subsequent logins, the midterm satisfaction, all the way to churn; in increasing order of prediction horizon. These predictive models are tested first offline and then evaluated online over several iterations and over time. In the evaluation phase, preferences, and interaction patterns are captured again as a feedback loop. Aside from the measurable user feedback signals, a platform can also take hidden signals into consideration. In this thesis, we give some attention to user intent (watching a next episode on a favorite show, looking for new content, bookmarking items for later viewership). Besides satisfying the users, the platform also has to ensure that the content it offers is \emph{diverse} and promotes representative. For example, promoting screenwriters of different genres, movies in different languages, a variety of movie genres. These concerns are revisited below.

These steps help to capture user intent, preferences, and interaction patterns; the input for personalization tools. This thesis presents some novel methods and tools for improving the pipeline along this user journey. 

In this thesis, we propose individual tools that map to the user journey above, for the steps of \emph{recommendations}, \emph{thumbnail} selection, \emph{intent-satisfaction} linking and \emph{diversity} measurement. Together, these tools form our proposed \textbf{personalization pipeline}. For \emph{recommendations}, we found a good amount of literature on diffusion models \cite{} for continuous 2D structured data but little-to-no literature on any relaxation of the above. We propose to explore formulation of diffusion models for 1D binary unstructured data. As for personalized \emph{thumbnails}, existing research in multilabel image classification is highly reliant on variations of the binary cross-entropy loss \cite{}, but we think that the multilabel setting (as opposed to the binary or multiclass setting) requires its own solution. For the next step, we identified a lack of a systematic approach for \emph{intent-satisfaction} studies, that would provide survey design, code and modern Bayesian approaches to the problem. Finally, we could not find a \emph{diversity} metric that is distribution agnostic and rank-aware, to adapt to any normative standpoints of a platform issuing news / movies recommendations.

%The tools we propose here are: a generative model for creating diverse and relevant recommendation strips for the home page; a multilabel classifier for selecting optimal thumbnails for each video; a survey-based method for predicting user satisfaction from intent and behavior; and a set of metrics for measuring content diversity and avoiding unwanted biases.



In short, we focus on the video streaming platform ecosystem, exploring the challenges and opportunities of personalization, recommendation, and user behavior analysis. By combining survey methods, content modeling, adaptive testing, and behavioral analysis, this study aims to contribute to the development of video streaming platforms that can provide user satisfaction in a responsible way.
