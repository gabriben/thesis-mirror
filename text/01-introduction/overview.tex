This first chapter introduces the main topics and goals of this thesis, and suggests some possible ways to read it. The thesis has six chapters in total, and this is the first one. The following four chapters each address one of the research questions that we presented in Section~\ref{section:introduction:rqs}. Each chapter is based on a paper (see Section~\ref{section:introduction:origins} below), and can be read on its own. If the reader is interested in the entire thesis, we recommend following the original order of chapters, as they follow the \emph{user journey} and its respective \emph{personalization pipeline} on a streaming platform. The final chapter summarizes the main findings and contributions of this thesis, and proposes some future research directions.
