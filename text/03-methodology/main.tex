A chapter on the general research methodology. You can use this chapter to introduce your baseline system, if it is the same in several chapters (e.g., language modeling). Also, you can list the document collections you use here (e.g., TREC collections, with details of the collection, topics, assessments, preprocessing, etc.). Finally, introduce metrics you refer to in research chapters and explain why you use these, and give details on significance tests you use.

Just put everything in here that is used in more than one research chapter, you can simply refer back to this chapter.
