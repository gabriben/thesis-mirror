abstract = {Logged behavioral data is a common resource for enhancing the user experience on streaming platforms. In music streaming,&nbsp;Mehrotra et&nbsp;al. have shown how complementing behavioral data with user intent can help predict and explain user satisfaction. Do their findings extend to video streaming? Compared to music streaming, video streaming platforms provide relatively shallow catalogs. Finding the right content demands more active and conscious commitment from users than in the music streaming setting. Video streaming platforms, in particular, could thus benefit from a better understanding of user intents and satisfaction level. We replicate&nbsp;Mehrotra et&nbsp;al.’s study from music to video streaming and extend their modeling framework on two fronts: (i) improved modeling accuracy (random forests), and (ii) interpretability (Bayesian models).Like the original study, we find that user intent affects behavior and satisfaction itself, even if to a lesser degree, based on data analysis and modeling. By proposing a grouping of intents into decisive and explorative categories we highlight a tension: decisive video streamers are not as keen to interact with the user interface as exploration-seeking ones. Meanwhile, music streamers explore by listening. In this study, we find that in video streaming, unsatisfied users provide the main signal: intent influences satisfaction levels together with behavioral data, depending on our decisive vs. explorative grouping.},

abstract = {In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.},

abstract = {Generative information retrieval (IR) has experienced substantial growth across multiple research communities (e.g., information retrieval, computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning), and has been highly visible in the popular press. Theoretical, empirical, and actual user-facing products have been released that retrieve documents (via generation) or directly generate answers given an input request. We would like to investigate whether end-to-end generative models are just another trend or, as some claim, a paradigm change for IR. This necessitates new metrics, theoretical grounding, evaluation methods, task definitions, models, user interfaces, etc. The goal of this workshop1 is to focus on previously explored Generative IR techniques like document retrieval and direct Grounded Answer Generation, while also offering a venue for the discussion and exploration of how Generative IR can be applied to new domains like recommendation systems, summarization, etc. The format of the workshop is interactive, including roundtable and keynote sessions and tends to avoid the one-sided dialogue of a mini-conference.},

abstract = {Detecting and understanding implicit measures of user satisfaction are essential for enhancing recommendation quality. When users interact with a recommendation system, they leave behind fine grained traces of interaction signals, which contain valuable information that could help gauging user satisfaction. User interaction with such systems is often motivated by a specific need or intent, often not explicitly specified by the user, but can nevertheless inform on how the user interacts with, and the extent to which the user is satisfied by the recommendations served. In this work, we consider a complex recommendation scenario, called Slate Recommendation, wherein a user is presented with an ordered set of collections, called slates, in a specific page layout. We focus on the context of music streaming and leverage fine-grained user interaction signals to tackle the problem of predicting user satisfaction. We hypothesize that user interactions are conditional on the specific intent users have when interacting with a recommendation system, and highlight the need for explicitly considering user intent when interpreting interaction signals. We present diverse approaches to identify user intents (interviews, surveys and a quantitative approach) and identify a set of common intents users have in a music streaming recommendation setting. Additionally, we identify the importance of shared learning across intents and propose a multi-level hierarchical model for user satisfaction prediction that leverages user intent information alongside interaction signals. Our findings from extensive experiments on a large scale real world data demonstrate (i) the utility of considering different interaction signals, (ii) the role of intents in interpreting user interactions and (iii) the interplay between interaction signals and intents in predicting user satisfaction.},

abstract = {User behavior provides many cues to improve the relevance of search results through personalization. One aspect of user behavior that provides especially strong signals for delivering better relevance is an individual's history of queries and clicked documents. Previous studies have explored how short-term behavior or long-term behavior can be predictive of relevance. Ours is the first study to assess how short-term (session) behavior and long-term (historic) behavior interact, and how each may be used in isolation or in combination to optimally contribute to gains in relevance through search personalization. Our key findings include: historic behavior provides substantial benefits at the start of a search session; short-term session behavior contributes the majority of gains in an extended search session; and the combination of session and historic behavior out-performs using either alone. We also characterize how the relative contribution of each model changes throughout the duration of a session. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that leverage user behavior to personalize the search experience.},

abstract = {We formulate and study search algorithms that consider a user's prior interactions with a wide variety of content to personalize that user's current Web search. Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.},

There are two types of approach to build a hybrid model, i.e., the whole data approach and the segmented data approach. In this research, we present a new structure of the latter type of hybrid model, which we shall call SePI. In the SePI, input data is segmented using the performance information of the models tried in the training phase. We applied the SePI to a real customer churn problem of a Korean company that provides streaming digital music services through Internet. The result shows that the SePI outperformed any model that employed only one data mining technique such as artificial neural network, decision tree and logistic regression.",

Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.}

No one measure is universally best for all accuracy assessment objectives, and different accuracy measures may lead to conflicting conclusions because the measures do not represent accuracy in the same tray. Choosing appropriate accuracy measures that address objectives of the mapping project is critical. Characteristics of some commonly used accuracy measures are described, and relationships among these measures are provided to aid the user in choosing an appropriate measure. Accuracy measures that are directly interpretable as probabilities of encountering certain types of misclassification errors or correct classifications should be selected in. preference to measures not interpretable as such. User's and producer's accuracy and the overall proportion OF area correctly classified are examples of accuracy measures possessing the desired probabilistic interpretation. The kappa coefficient of agreement does not possess such a probabilistic interpretation because of the adjustment for hypothetical chance agreement incorporated into this measure, and the strong dependence of kappa on the marginal proportions of the error matrix makes the utility of kappa for comparisons suspect. Normalizing an error matrix results in estimates that are not consistent for accuracy paramteters of the map being assessed, so that this procedure is generally not warranted for most applications.}
