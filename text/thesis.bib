abstract = {Logged behavioral data is a common resource for enhancing the user experience on streaming platforms. In music streaming,&nbsp;Mehrotra et&nbsp;al. have shown how complementing behavioral data with user intent can help predict and explain user satisfaction. Do their findings extend to video streaming? Compared to music streaming, video streaming platforms provide relatively shallow catalogs. Finding the right content demands more active and conscious commitment from users than in the music streaming setting. Video streaming platforms, in particular, could thus benefit from a better understanding of user intents and satisfaction level. We replicate&nbsp;Mehrotra et&nbsp;al.’s study from music to video streaming and extend their modeling framework on two fronts: (i) improved modeling accuracy (random forests), and (ii) interpretability (Bayesian models).Like the original study, we find that user intent affects behavior and satisfaction itself, even if to a lesser degree, based on data analysis and modeling. By proposing a grouping of intents into decisive and explorative categories we highlight a tension: decisive video streamers are not as keen to interact with the user interface as exploration-seeking ones. Meanwhile, music streamers explore by listening. In this study, we find that in video streaming, unsatisfied users provide the main signal: intent influences satisfaction levels together with behavioral data, depending on our decisive vs. explorative grouping.},

abstract = {In traditional recommender system literature, diversity is often seen as the opposite of similarity, and typically defined as the distance between identified topics, categories or word models. However, this is not expressive of the social science’s interpretation of diversity, which accounts for a news organization’s norms and values and which we here refer to as normative diversity. We introduce RADio, a versatile metrics framework to evaluate recommendations according to these normative goals. RADio introduces a rank-aware Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence. This combination accounts for (i) a user’s decreasing propensity to observe items further down a list and (ii) full distributional shifts as opposed to point estimates. We evaluate RADio’s ability to reflect five normative concepts in news recommendations on the Microsoft News Dataset and six (neural) recommendation algorithms, with the help of our metadata enrichment pipeline. We find that RADio provides insightful estimates that can potentially be used to inform news recommender system design.},
