Prior to 2018, all theses had a related work chapter, followed by chapters corresponding to three or more published papers.

From 2018 onwards, a thesis may also do without related work chapter, and it needs to have four chapters based on four or more published papers.  

The related work chapter. Usually just a collection of the related work sections of the papers, with some additional introducing background work on your area (e.g., introduction to IR). List here which topics you discuss in this section.

Of course, you could refer to the work by \citet{meij2010thesis} or \citet{weerkamp2011thesis}.
